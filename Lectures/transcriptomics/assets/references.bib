ESTs have applications in the discovery of new human genes, mapping of the human genome, and identification of coding regions in genomic sequences. Of the sequences generated, 337 represent new genes, including 48 with significant similarity to genes from other organisms, such as a yeast RNA polymerase II subunit; Drosophila kinesin, Notch, and Enhancer of split; and a murine tyrosine kinase receptor. Forty-six ESTs were mapped to chromosomes after amplification by the polymerase chain reaction.

The existing FANTOM5 human and mouse miRNA atlas was supplemented with rat, dog, and chicken datasets. The sixth (latest) edition of the FANTOM project was launched to assess the function of human long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs). From its creation until 2020, FANTOM6 has contributed to the research community a large dataset generated from the knock-down of 285 lncRNAs in human dermal fibroblasts; this is followed with extensive expression profiling and cellular phenotyping. Other updates to the FANTOM resource includes the reprocessing of the miRNA and promoter atlases of human, mouse and chicken with the latest reference genome assemblies. To facilitate the use and accessibility of all above resources we further enhanced FANTOM data viewers and web interfaces.

To test the system, 864 physically mapped lambda clones of yeast genomic DNA, together representing >75% of the yeast genome, were arranged into 1.8-cm x 1.8-cm arrays, each containing a total of 1744 elements. The microarrays were characterized by simultaneous hybridization of two different sets of isolated yeast chromosomes labeled with two different fluorophores. A laser fluorescent scanner was used to detect the hybridization signals from the two fluorophores. The results demonstrate the utility of DNA microarrays in the analysis of complex DNA samples. This system should find numerous applications in genome-wide genetic mapping, physical mapping, and gene expression studies.},

Our analyses make use of three data sets: a small experimental study consisting of five MGU74A mouse GeneChip® arrays, part of the data from an extensive spike‐in study conducted by Gene Logic and Wyeth's Genetics Institute involving 95 HG‐U95A human GeneChip® arrays; and part of a dilution study conducted by Gene Logic involving 75 HG‐U95A GeneChip® arrays. We display some familiar features of the perfect match and mismatch probe (PM and MM) values of these data, and examine the variance–mean relationship with probe‐level data from probes believed to be defective, and so delivering noise only. We explain why we need to normalize the arrays to one another using probe level intensities. We then examine the behavior of the PM and MM using spike‐in data and assess three commonly used summary measures: Affymetrix's (i) average difference (AvDiff) and (ii) MAS 5.0 signal, and (iii) the Li and Wong multiplicative model‐based expression index (MBEI). The exploratory data analyses of the probe level data motivate a new summary measure that is a robust multi‐array average (RMA) of background‐adjusted, normalized, and log‐transformed PM values. We evaluate the four expression summary measures using the dilution study data, assessing their behavior in terms of bias, variance and (for MBEI and RMA) model fit. Finally, we evaluate the algorithms in terms of their ability to detect known levels of differential expression using the spike‐in data. We conclude that there is no obvious downside to using RMA and attaching a standard error (SE) to this quantity using a linear model which removes probe‐specific affinities.},

 abstract = {The common approach to the multiplicity problem calls for controlling the familywise error rate (FWER). This approach, though, has faults, and we point out a few. A different approach to problems of multiple significance testing is presented. It calls for controlling the expected proportion of falsely rejected hypotheses-the false discovery rate. This error rate is equivalent to the FWER when all hypotheses are true but is smaller otherwise. Therefore, in problems where the control of the false discovery rate rather than that of the FWER is desired, there is potential for a gain in power. A simple sequential Bonferroni-type procedure is proved to control the false discovery rate for independent test statistics, and a simulation study shows that the gain in power is substantial. The use of the new procedure and the appropriateness of the criterion are illustrated with examples.},

ABSTRACT = {Noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs) constitute the majority of the human transcribed genome. This largest class of RNA transcripts plays diverse roles in a multitude of cellular processes, and has been implicated in many pathological conditions, especially cancer. The different subclasses of ncRNAs include microRNAs, a class of short ncRNAs; and a variety of long ncRNAs (lncRNAs), such as lincRNAs, antisense RNAs, pseudogenes, and circular RNAs. Many studies have demonstrated the involvement of these ncRNAs in competitive regulatory interactions, known as competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) networks, whereby lncRNAs can act as microRNA decoys to modulate gene expression. These interactions are often interconnected, thus aberrant expression of any network component could derail the complex regulatory circuitry, culminating in cancer development and progression. Recent integrative analyses have provided evidence that new computational platforms and experimental approaches can be harnessed together to distinguish key ceRNA interactions in specific cancers, which could facilitate the identification of robust biomarkers and therapeutic targets, and hence, more effective cancer therapies and better patient outcome and survival.},

              a challenging and yet unsolved problem because of the
              non-contiguous transcript structure, relatively short read lengths
              and constantly increasing throughput of the sequencing
              technologies. Currently available RNA-seq aligners suffer from
              high mapping error rates, low mapping speed, read length
              limitation and mapping biases. RESULTS: To align our large (>80
              billon reads) ENCODE Transcriptome RNA-seq dataset, we developed
              the Spliced Transcripts Alignment to a Reference (STAR) software
              based on a previously undescribed RNA-seq alignment algorithm that
              uses sequential maximum mappable seed search in uncompressed
              suffix arrays followed by seed clustering and stitching procedure.
              STAR outperforms other aligners by a factor of >50 in mapping
              speed, aligning to the human genome 550 million 2 × 76 bp
              paired-end reads per hour on a modest 12-core server, while at the

              addition to unbiased de novo detection of canonical junctions,
              STAR can discover non-canonical splices and chimeric (fusion)
              transcripts, and is also capable of mapping full-length RNA
              sequences. Using Roche 454 sequencing of reverse transcription

              1960 novel intergenic splice junctions with an 80-90\% success

    abstract = {Understanding the normal state of human tissue transcriptome profiles is essential for recognizing tissue disease states and identifying disease markers. Recently, the Human Protein Atlas and the FANTOM5 consortium have each published extensive transcriptome data for human samples using Illumina-sequenced RNA-Seq and Heliscope-sequenced CAGE. Here, we report on the first large-scale complex tissue transcriptome comparison between full-length versus 5′-capped mRNA sequencing data. Overall gene expression correlation was high between the 22 corresponding tissues analyzed (R \&gt; 0.8). For genes ubiquitously expressed across all tissues, the two data sets showed high genome-wide correlation (91\% agreement), with differences observed for a small number of individual genes indicating the need to update their gene models. Among the identified single-tissue enriched genes, up to 75\% showed consensus of 7-fold enrichment in the same tissue in both methods, while another 17\% exhibited multiple tissue enrichment and/or high expression variety in the other data set, likely dependent on the cell type proportions included in each tissue sample. Our results show that RNA-Seq and CAGE tissue transcriptome data sets are highly complementary for improving gene model annotations and highlight biological complexities within tissue transcriptomes. Furthermore, integration with image-based protein expression data is highly advantageous for understanding expression specificities for many genes.},

              quantifications are inherently more uncertain than gene-level read
              counts because of ambiguous assignment of sequence reads to
              transcripts. While sequence reads can usually be assigned
              unambiguously to a gene, reads are very often compatible with
              multiple transcripts for that gene, particularly for genes with
              many isoforms. Software tools designed for gene-level differential
              expression do not perform optimally on transcript counts because
              the read-to-transcript ambiguity (RTA) disrupts the mean-variance
              relationship normally observed for gene level RNA-seq data and
              interferes with the efficiency of the empirical Bayes dispersion

              provide bootstrap samples from which quantification uncertainty

 abstract = {DNA microarrays are a new and promising biotechnology which allows the monitoring of expression levels in cells for thousands of genes simultaneously. The present paper describes statistical methods for the identification of differentially expressed genes in replicated cDNA microarray experiments. Although it is not the main focus of the paper, new methods for the important pre-processing steps of image analysis and normalization are proposed. Given suitably normalized data, the biological question of differential expression is restated as a problem in multiple hypothesis testing: the simultaneous test for each gene of the null hypothesis of no association between the expression levels and responses or covariates of interest. Differentially expressed genes are identified based on adjusted p-values for a multiple testing procedure which strongly controls the family-wise Type I error rate and takes into account the dependence structure between the gene expression levels. No specific parametric form is assumed for the distribution of the test statistics and a permutation procedure is used to estimate adjusted p-values. Several data displays are suggested for the visual identification of differentially expressed genes and of important features of these genes. The above methods are applied to microarray data from a study of gene expression in the livers of mice with very low HDL cholesterol levels. The genes identified using data from multiple slides are compared to those identified by recently published single-slide methods.},

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: RNA-Seq is revolutionizing the way transcript
              abundances are measured. A key challenge in transcript
              quantification from RNA-Seq data is the handling of reads that map
              to multiple genes or isoforms. This issue is particularly
              important for quantification with de novo transcriptome assemblies
              in the absence of sequenced genomes, as it is difficult to
              determine which transcripts are isoforms of the same gene. A
              second significant issue is the design of RNA-Seq experiments, in
              terms of the number of reads, read length, and whether reads come
              from one or both ends of cDNA fragments. RESULTS: We present RSEM,
              an user-friendly software package for quantifying gene and isoform
              abundances from single-end or paired-end RNA-Seq data. RSEM
              outputs abundance estimates, 95\% credibility intervals, and
              visualization files and can also simulate RNA-Seq data. In
              contrast to other existing tools, the software does not require a
              reference genome. Thus, in combination with a de novo
              transcriptome assembler, RSEM enables accurate transcript
              quantification for species without sequenced genomes. On simulated
              and real data sets, RSEM has superior or comparable performance to
              quantification methods that rely on a reference genome. Taking
              advantage of RSEM's ability to effectively use ambiguously-mapping
              reads, we show that accurate gene-level abundance estimates are
              best obtained with large numbers of short single-end reads. On the
              other hand, estimates of the relative frequencies of isoforms
              within single genes may be improved through the use of paired-end
              reads, depending on the number of possible splice forms for each
              gene. CONCLUSIONS: RSEM is an accurate and user-friendly software
              tool for quantifying transcript abundances from RNA-Seq data. As
              it does not rely on the existence of a reference genome, it is
              particularly useful for quantification with de novo transcriptome
              assemblies. In addition, RSEM has enabled valuable guidance for
              cost-efficient design of quantification experiments with RNA-Seq,
              which is currently relatively expensive.",

              associated with diabetic fracture. We used an unbiased approach to
              compare GE in the fracture callus of Zucker diabetic fatty (ZDF)
              rats relative to wild-type (WT) littermates at three weeks
              following femoral osteotomy. METHODS: Zucker rats, WT and
              homozygous for leptin receptor mutation (ZDF), were fed a
              moderately high-fat diet to induce T2DM only in the ZDF animals.
              At ten weeks of age, open femoral fractures were simulated using a
              unilateral osteotomy stabilized with an external fixator. At three
              weeks post-surgery, the fractured femur from each animal was
              retrieved for analysis. Callus formation and the extent of healing
              were assessed by radiograph and histology. Bone tissue was
              processed for total RNA extraction and messenger RNA (mRNA)
              sequencing (mRNA-Seq). RESULTS: Radiographs and histology
              demonstrated impaired fracture healing in ZDF rats with incomplete
              bony bridge formation and an influx of intramedullary inflammatory
              tissue. In comparison, near-complete bridging between cortices was
              observed in Sham WT animals. Of 13,160 genes, mRNA-Seq analysis
              identified 13 that were differentially expressed in ZDF rat

              Seven genes were upregulated with high confidence (FDR = 0.05) in
              ZDF fracture callus, most with known roles in inflammation.
              CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that elevated or prolonged
              inflammation contributes to delayed fracture healing in T2DM. The
              identified genes may be used as biomarkers to monitor and treat

               studies aim at comparing either abundance levels or the
               transcriptome composition between given conditions, and as a
               first step, the sequencing reads must be used as the basis for
               abundance quantification of transcriptomic features of interest,
               such as genes or transcripts. Various quantification approaches
               have been proposed, ranging from simple counting of reads that

              in which a P-value is assigned to a set of genes as a unit. Gene
              set tests are valuable for increasing statistical power,
              organizing and interpreting results and for relating expression
              patterns across different experiments. Existing methods are based
              on permutation. Methods that rely on permutation of probes
              unrealistically assume independence of genes, while those that
              rely on permutation of sample are suitable only for two-group
              comparisons with a good number of replicates in each group.
              RESULTS: We present ROAST, a statistically rigorous gene set test
              that allows for gene-wise correlation while being applicable to
              almost any experimental design. Instead of permutation, ROAST uses
              rotation, a Monte Carlo technology for multivariate regression.
              Since the number of rotations does not depend on sample size,
              ROAST gives useful results even for experiments with minimal
              replication. ROAST allows for any experimental design that can be
              expressed as a linear model, and can also incorporate array
              weights and correlated samples. ROAST can be tuned for situations
              in which only a subset of the genes in the set are actively
              involved in the molecular pathway. ROAST can test for uni- or
              bi-direction regulation. Probes can also be weighted to allow for
              prior importance. The power and size of the ROAST procedure is
              demonstrated in a simulation study, and compared to that of a
              representative permutation method. Finally, ROAST is used to test
              the degree of transcriptional conservation between human and mouse
              mammary stems. AVAILABILITY: ROAST is implemented as a function in

               orthology and annotate the orthologous groups (OGs) with
               functional and evolutionary traits. OrthoDB is the leading
               resource for species diversity, striving to sample the most
               diverse and well-researched organisms with the highest quality
               genomic data. This update expands to include 5827 eukaryotic
               genomes. We have also added coding DNA sequences (CDSs) and gene
               loci coordinates. OrthoDB can be browsed, downloaded, or accessed
               using REST API, SPARQL/RDF and now also via API packages for
               Python and R Bioconductor. OrthoLoger
               (https://orthologer.ezlab.org), the tool used for inferring
               orthologs in OrthoDB, is now available as a Conda package and
               through BioContainers. ODB-mapper, a component of OrthoLoger,
               streamlines annotation of genes from newly sequenced genomes with
               OrthoDB evolutionary and functional descriptors. The benchmarking
               sets of universal single-copy orthologs (BUSCO), derived from
               OrthoDB, had correspondingly a major update. The BUSCO tool
               (https://busco.ezlab.org) has become a standard in genomics,
               uniquely capable of assessing both eukaryotic and prokaryotic
               species. It is applicable to gene sets, transcriptomes, genome
               assemblies and metagenomic bins.",

This review outlines key advances in DRS, including optimized protocols for mRNA, rRNA, tRNA, circRNA, and viral RNA, as well as analytical tools for isoform quantification, poly(A) tail measurement, fusion transcript identification, and base modification profiling. We highlight how DRS has redefined transcriptomic studies across diverse systems—from uncovering novel transcripts and alternative splicing events in cancer, plants, and parasites to enabling the direct detection of m6A, m5C, pseudouridine, and RNA editing events. Emerging applications such as co-transcriptional splicing analysis, lncRNA and circRNA discovery, and real-time RNA structural mapping are also discussed. Beyond basic research, DRS offers powerful capabilities in mRNA vaccine quality control and RNA-based data storage. Despite current limitations in sequencing accuracy, input requirements, and cost, ongoing improvements in nanopore chemistry, basecalling algorithms, and machine learning integration are rapidly expanding DRS utility. As it matures, DRS is poised to become a core platform for high-resolution transcriptome profiling, RNA regulatory analysis, and integrative multi-omics applications, offering novel insights into gene expression, regulation, and evolution.}

Sequencing full-length native RNAs using long-read direct RNA sequencing (DRS) has the potential to overcome many limitations of short and long-read sequencing methods that require RNA fragmentation, cDNA synthesis or PCR. However, there are a lack of tools specifically designed for DRS and its ability to identify differential expression in complex organisms is poorly characterised. We developed NanoCount for fast, accurate transcript isoform quantification in DRS and demonstrate it outperforms similar methods. Using synthetic controls and human SH-SY5Y cell differentiation into neuron-like cells, we show that DRS accurately quantifies RNA expression and identifies differential expression of genes and isoforms. Differential expression of 231 genes, 333 isoforms, plus 27 isoform switches were detected between undifferentiated and differentiated SH-SY5Y cells and samples clustered by differentiation state at the gene and isoform level. Genes upregulated in neuron-like cells were associated with neurogenesis. NanoCount quantification of thousands of novel isoforms discovered with DRS likewise enabled identification of their differential expression. Our results demonstrate enhanced DRS isoform quantification with NanoCount and establish the ability of DRS to identify biologically relevant differential expression of genes and isoforms.},

               RNA-seq has fueled much discovery and innovation in medicine over

               conducted on samples comprising thousands to millions of cells.

  abstract  = "BACKGROUND: Normalization is a critical step in the analysis of
               single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) datasets. Its main goal is
               to make gene counts comparable within and between cells. To do
               so, normalization methods must account for technical and
               biological variability. Numerous normalization methods have been
               developed addressing different sources of dispersion and making
               specific assumptions about the count data. MAIN BODY: The
               selection of a normalization method has a direct impact on
               downstream analysis, for example differential gene expression and
               cluster identification. Thus, the objective of this review is to
               guide the reader in making an informed decision on the most
               appropriate normalization method to use. To this aim, we first
               give an overview of the different single cell sequencing
               platforms and methods commonly used including isolation and
               library preparation protocols. Next, we discuss the inherent
               sources of variability of scRNA-seq datasets. We describe the
               categories of normalization methods and include examples of each.
               We also delineate imputation and batch-effect correction methods.
               Furthermore, we describe data-driven metrics commonly used to
               evaluate the performance of normalization methods. We also
               discuss common scRNA-seq methods and toolkits used for integrated
               data analysis. CONCLUSIONS: According to the correction
               performed, normalization methods can be broadly classified as
               within and between-sample algorithms. Moreover, with respect to
               the mathematical model used, normalization methods can further be
               classified into: global scaling methods, generalized linear
               models, mixed methods, and machine learning-based methods. Each
               of these methods depict pros and cons and make different
               statistical assumptions. However, there is no better performing
               normalization method. Instead, metrics such as silhouette width,
               K-nearest neighbor batch-effect test, or Highly Variable Genes
               are recommended to assess the performance of normalization
               methods.",

               tools to study complex biological processes such as mammalian
               embryogenesis. However, the imbalance between resolution, gene
               capture, and field of view of current methodologies precludes
               their systematic application to analyze relatively large and
               three-dimensional mid- and late-gestation embryos. Here, we
               combined DNA nanoball (DNB)-patterned arrays and in situ RNA
               capture to create spatial enhanced resolution omics-sequencing
               (Stereo-seq). We applied Stereo-seq to generate the mouse
               organogenesis spatiotemporal transcriptomic atlas (MOSTA), which
               maps with single-cell resolution and high sensitivity the
               kinetics and directionality of transcriptional variation during
               mouse organogenesis. We used this information to gain insight
               into the molecular basis of spatial cell heterogeneity and cell
               fate specification in developing tissues such as the dorsal
               midbrain. Our panoramic atlas will facilitate in-depth
               investigation of longstanding questions concerning normal and

               histological details of transcriptomic profiles; however, they

               Seq-Scope, a spatial barcoding technology with a resolution
               comparable to an optical microscope. Seq-Scope is based on a
               solid-phase amplification of randomly barcoded single-molecule
               oligonucleotides using an Illumina sequencing platform. The
               resulting clusters annotated with spatial coordinates are
               processed to expose RNA-capture moiety. These RNA-capturing
               barcoded clusters define the pixels of Seq-Scope that are
               ∼0.5-0.8 μm apart from each other. From tissue sections,
               Seq-Scope visualizes spatial transcriptome heterogeneity at
               multiple histological scales, including tissue zonation according
               to the portal-central (liver), crypt-surface (colon) and
               inflammation-fibrosis (injured liver) axes, cellular components
               including single-cell types and subtypes, and subcellular
               architectures of nucleus and cytoplasm. Seq-Scope is quick,
               straightforward, precise, and easy-to-implement and makes spatial
               single-cell analysis accessible to a wide group of biomedical

               First, we leverage the detection efficiency of Slide-seqV2 to
               identify dendritically localized mRNAs in neurons of the mouse
               hippocampus. Second, we integrate the spatial information of

               characterize the spatiotemporal development of the mouse
               neocortex, identifying underlying genetic programs that were
               poorly sampled with Slide-seq. The combination of near-cellular
