  abstract = {SUMMARY The genomic integrity of every organism is endangered by various intrinsic and extrinsic stresses. To maintain genomic integrity, a sophisticated DNA damage response (DDR) network is activated rapidly after DNA damage. Notably, the fundamental DDR mechanisms are conserved in eukaryotes. However, knowledge about many regulatory aspects of the plant DDR is still limited. Important, yet little understood, regulatory factors of the DDR are the long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs). In humans, 13 lncRNAs functioning in DDR have been characterized to date, whereas no such lncRNAs have been characterized in plants yet. By meta-analysis, we identified the putative long intergenic non-coding RNA induced by DNA damage (LINDA) that responds strongly to various DNA double-strand break-inducing treatments, but not to replication stress induced by mitomycin C. After DNA damage, LINDA is rapidly induced in an ATM- and SOG1-dependent manner. Intriguingly, the transcriptional response of LINDA to DNA damage is similar to that of its flanking hypothetical protein-encoding gene. Phylogenetic analysis of putative Brassicales and Malvales LINDA homologs indicates that LINDA lncRNAs originate from duplication of a flanking small protein-encoding gene followed by pseudogenization. We demonstrate that LINDA is not only needed for the regulation of this flanking gene but also fine-tuning of the DDR after the occurrence of DNA double-strand breaks. Moreover, Δlinda mutant root stem cells are unable to recover from DNA damage, most likely due to hyper-induced cell death.},

              a challenging and yet unsolved problem because of the
              non-contiguous transcript structure, relatively short read lengths
              and constantly increasing throughput of the sequencing
              technologies. Currently available RNA-seq aligners suffer from
              high mapping error rates, low mapping speed, read length
              limitation and mapping biases. RESULTS: To align our large (>80
              billon reads) ENCODE Transcriptome RNA-seq dataset, we developed
              the Spliced Transcripts Alignment to a Reference (STAR) software
              based on a previously undescribed RNA-seq alignment algorithm that
              uses sequential maximum mappable seed search in uncompressed
              suffix arrays followed by seed clustering and stitching procedure.
              STAR outperforms other aligners by a factor of >50 in mapping
              speed, aligning to the human genome 550 million 2 × 76 bp
              paired-end reads per hour on a modest 12-core server, while at the
              same time improving alignment sensitivity and precision. In
              addition to unbiased de novo detection of canonical junctions,
              STAR can discover non-canonical splices and chimeric (fusion)
              transcripts, and is also capable of mapping full-length RNA
              sequences. Using Roche 454 sequencing of reverse transcription
              polymerase chain reaction amplicons, we experimentally validated
              1960 novel intergenic splice junctions with an 80-90\% success
              rate, corroborating the high precision of the STAR mapping
              strategy. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: STAR is implemented as

  abstract = {Summary Noncoding RNAs have been extensively described in plant and animal transcriptomes by using high-throughput sequencing technology. Of these noncoding RNAs, a growing number of long intergenic noncoding RNAs (lincRNAs) have been described in multicellular organisms, however the origins and functions of many lincRNAs remain to be explored. In many eukaryotic genomes, transposable elements (TEs) are widely distributed and often account for large fractions of plant and animal genomes yet the contribution of TEs to lincRNAs is largely unknown. By using strand-specific RNA-sequencing, we profiled the expression patterns of lincRNAs in Arabidopsis, rice and maize, and identified 47 611 and 398 TE-associated lincRNAs (TE-lincRNAs), respectively. TE-lincRNAs were more often derived from retrotransposons than DNA transposons and as retrotransposon copy number in both rice and maize genomes so did TE-lincRNAs. We validated the expression of these TE-lincRNAs by strand-specific RT-PCR and also demonstrated tissue-specific transcription and stress-induced TE-lincRNAs either after salt, abscisic acid (ABA) or cold treatments. For Arabidopsis TE-lincRNA11195, mutants had reduced sensitivity to ABA as demonstrated by longer roots and higher shoot biomass when compared to wild-type. Finally, by altering the chromatin state in the Arabidopsis chromatin remodelling mutant ddm1, unique lincRNAs including TE-lincRNAs were generated from the preceding untranscribed regions and interestingly inherited in a wild-type background in subsequent generations. Our findings not only demonstrate that TE-associated lincRNAs play important roles in plant abiotic stress responses but lincRNAs and TE-lincRNAs might act as an adaptive reservoir in eukaryotes.},

However, the complete range of functions of PSEN1 and PSEN2 is not yet understood. In this study, we performed targeted mutagenesis of the zebrafish psen2 gene to generate a premature termination codon close downstream of the translation start with the intention of creating a null mutation. Homozygotes for this mutation, psen2S4Ter, are viable and fertile, and adults do not show any gross psen2-dependent pigmentation defects, arguing against significant loss of γ-secretase activity. Also, assessment of the numbers of Dorsal Longitudinal Ascending (DoLA) interneurons that are responsive to psen2 but not psen1 activity during embryogenesis did not reveal decreased psen2 function. Transcripts containing the S4Ter mutation show no evidence of destabilization by nonsense-mediated decay. Forced expression in zebrafish embryos of fusions of psen2S4Ter 5’ mRNA sequences with sequence encoding enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) indicated that the psen2S4Ter mutation permits utilization of cryptic, novel downstream translation start codons. These likely initiate translation of N-terminally truncated Psen2 proteins lacking late endosomal/lysosomal localization sequences and that obey the “reading frame preservation rule” of PRESENILIN EOfAD mutations. Transcriptome analysis of entire brains from a 6-month-old family of wild type, heterozygous and homozygous psen2S4Ter female siblings revealed profoundly dominant effects on gene expression likely indicating changes in ribosomal, mitochondrial, and anion transport functions.},
